== You're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub
is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce
Software (FOSS).  SFC is deeply concerned about using a proprietary
system like GitHub to develop any FOSS project.  SFC has an [open {bug
ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the project
contributors are actively discussing how to smoothly leave GitHub
in the long term.  SFC urges y'all to read about the [Give up
GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from [the Software Freedom
Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the
reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub,
please [check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send them your
contributions without using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is
done against the author's will.  SFC didn't consent to GitHub's use of
this project's code in Copilot.
