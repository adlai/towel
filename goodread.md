X About Me,.?

I'll do my best to adhere to sane consistency in use of the one-to-five star scale, since that is likely the most pervaded information; however, I might diverge from the site's suggested interpretations of the numbers.

My current usage target is:
1. star - see review for warnings in the case you plan to read the book
2. star -- I enjoyed the book enough to avoid warning anyone away from reading it themselves
3. star --- I enjoyed the book enough to regret not giving it four stars
4. star ---- uhrmmyeah, no...
5. star ----- Is that an adversarial neural network in your cerebellum, or are you just looking for something else to read?

The "political-fiction" shelf is for books that can be reliably placed somewhere within a Venn diagram of historical fiction and science fiction, where the plane of the diagram is an isochron of the current chiliad [i.e., the millenium approximately centered around my lifetime]; and those that definitely contain at least one falsehood in the application of technologies, as understood by this reviewer, may also be tagged as "scientific-mistakes".
